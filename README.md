I took some of my fave apps from /enc1 and veered in slightly different directoons. As such some of the apps in enc1 and most in enc2 (this repo) are very thoughtfully done. 

I do not update the readme for every code fix- to start with any app feed code and readme  to chatgpt 5 pro or higher and ask it to update the readme Any lower version of ai will give bad results.
