I took some of my fave apps from /enc1 and veered in slightly different directions. As such some of the apps in enc1 and most in enc2 (this repo) are very thoughtfully done. 

I do not update the readme for every code fix- to start with any app feed code and readme  to chatgpt 5 pro or higher and ask it to update the readme Any lower version of ai will give bad results. Ai will reliably have code edits every time you feed it the code, most of the time the edits are right on point, sometimes the edits sort of gaslight you.
